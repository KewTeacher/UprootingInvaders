<p> An environmental issue that is pervasive to everything around us are invasive species, both plants and animals. They eat up our native fauna that keeps us safe and alive, replacing them after depleting their numbers, creating less of a varied world that we need to survive. Without our native sand dunes, we’re hit harder and harder every year by hurricanes, losing our beaches to consistent erosion. Native trees that are in tune with our soil are also decaying, invasive insects and flora sapping them of their resources and thus adding to potential landslides that arise after a thorough rain. The project is meant to create an application that someone can use to identify the type of flora they’re looking at in attempts to identify the world around them. The user will take a picture of said plant and upload it. After such, application will output what type of plant it is after going through an API, and determine if it’s invasive. There will also be a geotag on the photo after you upload it, so other users know where the invasive plant is. The goal of our project is to aid the user in better understanding the fauna that surrounds them on a day-to-day basis, and what course of action should be taken in response to those that threaten our ecosystem. <p>
